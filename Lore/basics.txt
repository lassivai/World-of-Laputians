---- Laputian Culture - Basics ----

Laputians was an ancient civilization that may have existed from about 5000 BC to 1300 AD. One of the earliest memories of the culture is help given to Egyptians to build their pyramids (see notes about "aetherium" below).

The civilization is entirely governed by experts, scientist particularly of many fields. They keep hidden from other cultures so that the high technology of the Laputians isn't used for warfare. Laputians are thoroughly peaceful. (Although, there are exceptions, such as the super powerful cannon in the Laputa city.)

Hidden from other cultures, Laputian people and conscious machines live in either underground cities or flying cities. One of the last surviving flying cities after Laputians are no more, is called Laputa from which later civilizations gave the name for the entire civilization, the "Laputians". Laputians had other names for themselves during their time.

Two of the most defining things of the Laputians were 1) highly advanced science including robot technology, which was used to make conscious machines to help the people of Laputians, and 2) knowledge of a rare aetherium mineral, which could be used either as a battery to power the machines and other technology, or, via antigravitational virtues, make even whole cities fly. Using this antigravitational property, piling the heavy rocks of the great Egyptian pyramids was only a little challenge.
