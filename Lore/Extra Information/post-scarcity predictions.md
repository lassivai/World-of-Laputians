**Can you give me prediction for the time in years different commodities might become post-scarcity? For example food, water, clothing, housing, electricity, different kind of devices like computers and phones**

This is a complex question because "post-scarcity" depends heavily on distribution systems, political will, and what threshold we use. Here's my analysis based on technological capability vs. actual global implementation:

Near-term (10-30 years from now)
Information/Digital goods - Already effectively post-scarcity in terms of production cost (copying is free), but artificial scarcity maintained through IP laws

Electricity - 15-30 years for technical capability through solar/wind/battery systems, but distribution infrastructure is the bottleneck

Water - 20-40 years in most regions (desalination + solar is already viable, just needs scale)

Medium-term (30-60 years)
Food - 30-50 years (vertical farming, lab-grown meat, precision fermentation could provide abundance, but land ownership and distribution are political issues)

Basic clothing - 30-50 years (automated manufacturing is nearly there, but fast fashion business models resist this)

Basic computing devices - 40-60 years (hardware is cheap enough, but planned obsolescence and artificial market segmentation prevent this)

Long-term (60-100+ years)
Housing - 60-100+ years (construction automation is advancing slowly, but land scarcity is the real barrier - this is more about property rights than construction capacity)

Advanced electronics - 70-100 years (requires rare earth materials and complex supply chains)

Key caveat
The technological capability often arrives decades before actual post-scarcity implementation because:

-Property rights/land ownership
- Artificial scarcity business models
- Political resistance to redistribution
- Infrastructure investment requirements
- For Laputian civilization, they likely achieved this much faster (~200-300 years) due to aetherium abundance - and their cultural values prioritizing distribution over profit.
