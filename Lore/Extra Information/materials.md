Titanium - Aerospace, medical implants, high-performance applications; strong and lightweight

## Non-infinite Materials on Earth

Copper - Infinitely recyclable; proven reserves ~50-60 years at current consumption, but high recycling extends availability.

Aluminum - Infinitely recyclable without quality loss; reserves 100+ years, but 75% of all aluminum ever produced still in use

Plastics (polymers) - Limited recyclability (degrades with each cycle); depends on oil reserves

Lithium - Recyclable but not widely done yet; reserves 100-200 years at current use (rapidly growing demand may reduce this to 50-75 years)

Rare earth elements - Recyclable; reserves 300-1000+ years depending on specific element

Phosphorus - Non-renewable, cannot be synthesized; reserves 300-400 years; critical bottleneck for agriculture

Oil/petroleum - Non-renewable; proven reserves ~50 years at current consumption (not including unconventional sources)

Natural gas - Non-renewable; proven reserves ~50-55 years at current consumption

Coal - Non-renewable; proven reserves ~130-150 years at current consumption

Gold - Infinitely recyclable; ~70% of gold ever mined still in circulation; mining reserves ~20-30 years

Titanium - Recyclable; reserves 100+ years; 9th most abundant element in Earth's crust
