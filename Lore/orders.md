# Orders

Having learned from lessons in history that too much diversity may lead to misunderstandings, conflicts, and even wars, Laputian kinship is fortified by similar upbringing, and education so that all Laputians share the same core values, ethics, and worldview.

However, as much as over-diversity is avoided, diversity and the development of unique and personal "voice" is also encouraged. After all, the richness of life is based on biodiversity, and, Laputians think, it is always more fertile for the culture to advance through multiple threads of thought, art, and creativity.

One way of enforcing the diversity are nationally established "orders". When a new Laputian flying city is established it is designated a unique order. Each order has its own area of focus and themes that it emphasizes.

Because each order is attached to a particular flying city, every Laputian knows, that when speaking about the "City of Moon", we are also speaking about the "Order of Moon", and vice versa.

## Order of Moon

Having studied celestial objects for millennia, Laputians see nothing supernatural about them. That doesn't mean the senses of awe and wonder are missing. On the contrary, Laputians are deeply moved by the vastness of the universe around them. The Order reminds its members how very small the affairs of planet Earth are in the grand scheme of things. Similarly very small are the individual Laputian lives compared to planet Earth. Dealing with these facts continually, it is common to feel deep yearning and nostalgia among the members of this city for all the infinite possibilities of the Universe that one cannot ever truly grasp. The Citizens of Moon are widely known for their deep humility.

The City of Moon is equipped with telescopes and observatories to study everything outside Earth's atmosphere. Visitors of the city may enjoy changing exhibitions in the city's planetarium.

Because the good visibility of the starry sky is shared between all the flying cities, even outside City of Moon, the view of the nocturnal heavens is commonly known as the visual lullaby of all Laputians.

The city's distinctive musical sound is that of the modest and inconspicuous flute, which goes hand in hand with the humble character of the city's Citizens and the notion how very small a Laputian life is compared to the Universe. Flute's sound is soft and gentle, and beautiful melodies are played with it.

## Order of Snow

While Citizens of Moon go to the upper extreme of things, Citizens of Snow delve into the inner extreme of things. All Laputians are educated about the things forming materia, atoms particularly, and how matter changes its form one to another, a subject known as chemistry. For Citizens of Snow, these are fascinating beyond comprehension. In their quest to find the most fundamental aspects of the nature, Citizens of Snow go beyond observation and experimentation, they turn to the most abstract subject of them all: mathematics.

Because the infinite yet symmetrical shapes snowflakes assume, they are concidered the symbol of this order. Just as when uncounted snowflakes come together to form a glacier, so do uncounted molecules come together to form living cells, and uncounted cells come together to form a living being.

The Citizens of Snow are widely known for their affection for all the small things and how they see "an ocean in a drop of water" or "an infinity in a blink of an eye". Similarly well-known they are from how much more they value patterns, symmetries, and the processes in microscopic scale instead of the actual objects themselves.

Instead of painting impressive landscapes, heavenly objects or beautiful faces, Citizens of Snow are endlessly fascinated by the timeless beauty of the snowflakes, which are well represented in the walls of the city's corridors.

## Order of Flower

## Order of Rock

The minerals of the rocky Earth are essential for all Laputian life. The undeground cities are carved into solid rock, and different types of rock are essential building blocks in the aboveground and flying cities. The mineral aetherium is the most revered mineral of all, as it enables the anti-gravitational technology that makes flying cities possible. Sustainable development is a central guiding force in the lives of Laputians. It has been calculated that the current resource usage is available for future Laputians for uncounted millennia to come.

In the City of Rock, the non-living and comparatively permanent aspects of Earth are deeply revered. The symbols of the order are mountains, valleys and other landscapes formed by plate tectonics, erosion, and other geological processes. Having a "bird's eye view" of the planet Earth from the flying city, the Citizens of Rock record the geological features of the planet in their maps and notes. Among the things they need to understand are why a certain river flows the way it does, and why the continents in the west have complementary shapes to those in the east. The Citizens of Rock have a very deep sense of time, because they understand how things mold into different type of things through the vast geological time scales. It is common for the non-Citizens of Rock to expect that when the Citizens of Rock speak about "yesterday" or things happened "recently", they are more likely referring to days millions of years ago.

Because how deeply they have ingrained the notion "from little hill to massive mountain, when given enough time", the Citizens of Rock are known for their patience and long-term thinking. They are not easily startled by daily news and fluctuations in the world. Instead they concentrate on the overall progress of things in the long run.

Deep drum sounds are distinctive for this city, played in steady rhythms.
