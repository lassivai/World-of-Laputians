# The Zaharam-Chapelle-Parunas Ethnographical Questionnaire

For several years, the standard questionnaire used by anthropologists studying various cultures in the Eastlands has been that of Dr. Ellandwine Zaharam of the Univ. of Auntimoany. While it has proven itself in the field, many philosophers have thought that it could be satisfactorily amplified by creating several new categories not addressed in the original and expanding some of the old categories with new questions. A committee of eight faculty and students worked to add questions to the questionnaire, the result of which is the following Zaharam-Chapelle-Parunas Ethnographical Questionnaire.

At nearly double the size of the original (and considerably larger than similar tools), concerns have been raised about the possible unwieldiness of the tool. In order to maintain the general utility of the questionnaire, several related main categories have been compressed, while new ones that were not addressed in the older questionnaires have been created. Individual related questions have often been compressed into a single multipart question; it is felt that this practice in no way affects the practicability of the tool. Also, several very good but extremely focussed or detail oriented questions have been left out. While it is keenly felt that persons living in a community can offer great insights into the various topic explored in the questionnaire, it is felt that questions along the line of "how do people feel about this" are best left out, as any of the questions herein explored may be reasonably followed up by this sort of perceptive interrogation.

The format of the new questionnaire is the same as the older verion, namely, a number of broad categories in which several related questions about a country or region or tribal structure may be explored. The main departure from the older format is in the elimination of the question numbers. It is felt that poorly worded or redundant questions could be more easily excised and new questions could be inserted if the numbers were eliminated. It has been made abundantly clear that no such questionnaire could ever be seen as compleat, however, the committee have striven to produce a workable and comprehensive tool rather than an absolutely compleat one. It is hoped that, as the needs arise, new main or subordinated categories can easily be inserted into the structure of the present questionnaire without disrupting the flow of questions or the layout of the questionnaire. The order of main categories is roughly from the broader concepts of Nature to the more specific aspects of the culture under consideration. It was felt that the questions should be left somewhat broad rather than focussed, as it is always possible to follow up an interview with questions seeking further detail. If highly detailed questions are asked from the outset, the interview can easily get bogged down in minutiae, for we would risk missing the forest for the trees. It is much to be hoped that this Questionnaire will be found of great use to any philosopher or student interested in gaining insight into the cultures and societies that peoples may divide themselves into.

## 1. Questions of Place.

**Describe the geography of where your society calls home.**

10-1000 underground cities (e.g. below the seafloor of Pacific Ocean) 
Maybe surface cities where food is grown.

**Describe the climate your society deals with. How severe are their seasons?**

Flying cities can hover anywhere on Earth, but usually in temperature of about 20-30 degrees Celsius.
Temperature in underground cities is artificially maintained; stable and mild, around 15-25 degrees Celsius.
The possible surface cities are located in all zones of Earth (polar, temperate, tropical), but usually in places with good soil and water for farming.

What kinds of natural disasters has this society gotten used to?
~~~
~~~
What importance (spiritual or cultural) do people ascribe to the geography?
~~~
Laputians don't believe in supernatural forces, but they are deeply grateful for Mother Nature for providing fertile land and gentle climate for them to live in. Laputians maintain sustainable development.
~~~
How do people feel about local landscapes being altered or used for a purpose other than what is traditional?
~~~
**Answer by AI:** Laputians are generally open to the idea of altering landscapes for the sake of development, as long as it is done in a sustainable way. They understand that some changes may be necessary to accommodate their growing population and to improve their quality of life. However, they also value the natural beauty of their surroundings and strive to preserve it whenever possible. There may be some resistance to large-scale alterations that could significantly impact the environment or disrupt local ecosystems, but overall, Laputians are pragmatic and willing to adapt to changing circumstances while still respecting nature.
