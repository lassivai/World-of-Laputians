# Who the Laputians are?

The lovers of life, nature, knowledge, peace and beauty.

## Culture

Thanks to post-scarcity economy (see below) each human Laputian is free to pursue their interests without the need to work for a living. Laputians have been raised from early childhood to deeply value curiosity and thankfulness for the gift of life. Thus, most Laputians are highly motivated to work hard and do meaningful contributions to the society, even without monetary incentives. Laputians believe that being a "gift" for fellow citizens is so much more important than monetary compensation. In Laputian society everything is "open source" by default.

While being true "reneissance" people, specialization is also important. Each Laputian is an expert of one or more fields, and they are expected (but not required) to contribute their expertise to the society, especially when solving political issues (see below).

Laputians believe that not all cultures are spiritually ready to handle the high-technology of Laputians (especially the capability to build powerful weaponry). This has lead Laputians to be cautious how much they interact with other cultures. For the most part, Laputians (humans or conscious machines) live in flying cities or underground cities hidden from the rest of the world. Being highly curious and hungry for knowledge, there are Laputians who secretly observe and record what is happening in other cultures.

## Post-scarcity Economy

Laputians have automated nearly all necessary labor using advanced robotics and AI, such as food production, commodity manufacturing, and infrastructure maintenance. The aetherium mineral ensures nearly limitless source of clean energy.

## Philosophy and Religion

- The Laputian civilization values co-operation and peaceful coexistence above all else. Violence is only used as a last resort.
- The Laputians believe in the pursuit of knowledge and beauty as the highest goals in life.
- The Laputians have a deep respect for nature and the environment, and strive to live in harmony with the natural world.
- Every Laputian "drinks the sense of equality and justice from the mother's milk", as the saying goes.
- Each Laputian has the right to believe in whatever religion or philosophy they wish, as long as it does not harm others. Anyhow, their universal education leads 99.9 % of the time to the religion of "Compassion and Curiosity".

### Beautiful Life

No second spent beautifully is wasted for the Laputians. In almost any decision any Laputian face during their life, they are mostly directed by the questions "is it beautiful?" or "which choise is more beautiful?".

Laputians experience beauty on many levels:
- Being directed by high values. E.g. does it increase equality and justice?
- Being directed by the inner vibes - feeling beautiful feelings is the inner mother language of all Laputians directing their lives.
- However, Laputians are not directed by negative or bad feelings to large extent. They are taught ways to feel anyhow accepted just the way they are, and find the meaning in those inner signals, whatever those might be. Experiencing and creating art is a normal way for Laputians to find beauty even in dark moments.
- Laputians find beauty in harmony. E.g. having a serious face when feeling down is considered beautiful. Also beautiful is a gracefully dancing body when feeling joyful.
- Creativity is essential incredient in every Laputian's life. Instead of creating things that other people might concider important, Laputians are highly inner-driven, which leads to deep harmony between the creator and the creation, which, of course, is beautiful.
    - All Laputians are taught to play keyboard instruments (made audible by synthesizers) and enjoy singing starting from early childhood. There are infinite amount of synthesizer sounds from which the little children may choose what please them, and about 100 "classical" synthesizer instruments most commonly heard in the music halls of Laputian civilization.
    - Moving the body and the limbs directed by inner feelings is normal for all Laputians. Thus, dancing is as normal for Laputians as walking.

### Complex Problems without Answers

Even while doing their best effort, Laputians understand that the human lives and the life in wild nature is never perfectly fair. Even little children in Laputian civilization understands how all life on Earth has risen with evolution by natural selection, which of course works by the most unfair principle.

Other trouble are machines with consciousness, which are integral part of Laputian civilization. How much and what kind of consciousness should a machine have? Is it fair to limit the consciousness of a robot and instead of giving the best possible consciousness, give it only a fraction of that? Is it fair to program the robot to do mundane tasks, when it could be given a more fulfilling life? Someone might concider the Laputian robots as slaves, which is of course a deeply unjust concept.

Because of these and other deeply unjust apects of life (human or wild), every Laputian feels every moment at least little, if not bigger, sadness within.

No one knows where the Laputians disappeared from Earth about 700 years ago. There are legends that claim, that to solve the deep sadness within every Laputian, they decided to leave their advanced civilization behind and instead start living in even better harmony with nature, practically as farmers carrying as little existential burden as possible.

## Politics

- There are no political parties.
- If there are people interested in political affairs, they are free to perform those. Otherwise the intelligent robots will take care of political issues.
- Every political problem is solved by dedicating the issue to the experts of the particular field, who will possibly do new research as much as possible, so that the most practical option is uncovered.
