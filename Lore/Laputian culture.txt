---- Miyazaki's Laputa: Castle in the Sky ----

Society: A technologically advanced ancient civilization that sought refuge from the wars on Earth.

Technology: The island is kept afloat by a giant "Aetherium" crystal, which also powered the city's sophisticated robots and weapons.

Lifestyle: The culture became a harmonious blend of nature and advanced technology, with robots and mechanical marvels integrated into an ecological utopia. The original inhabitants ultimately chose to leave the island, realizing the importance of reconnecting with nature on Earth

Contrast with Swift's Version: While Miyazaki was conscious of Swift's critique and referenced the idea of a high-tech empire, his vision ultimately serves as a reminder for humanity to embrace an ecological coexistence with technology, rather than using it for empire or destruction.

---- Laputa, Miyazaki vs. Swift ----

Utopia vs. Dystopia: Swift presents a satirical, dystopian view of an intellectual elite, while Miyazaki depicts a once-utopian society that was destroyed by the human desire for power and control.

Themes: Swift uses Laputa to critique the dangers of pure reason and science disconnected from practical life, whereas Miyazaki uses it to explore themes of nature, technology, and the destructive nature of humanity.

"Once upon a time there were people who tilled their fields with cattle in the country. They aspired to circle the sky like birds. So they built many different flying machines. Some were successful, others less. Then came industrialization and they dug into the earth. They dug deeper and deeper than people who did today. Because they wanted to recover neither iron nor tin, but Volculite."
