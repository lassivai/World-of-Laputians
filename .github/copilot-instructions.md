# AI Agent Instructions for World of Laputians

## Project Overview

This is a creative worldbuilding repository for **Laputian civilization** (inspired by Miyazaki's Laputa) and **Pacific Deep**, a planned 2D top-down video game. This is NOT a software codebase - it's a documentation/design project consisting entirely of markdown files for lore, game design, and personal diary.

## Core Concepts

- **Laputians**: Ancient civilization (5000 BC - 1300 AD) living in flying/underground cities, governed by scientist-experts, values peace, beauty, and knowledge
- **Aetherium**: Rare mineral with anti-gravitational properties, powers technology and enables flying cities
- **Conscious Machines**: Advanced AI robots that work alongside humans in the Laputian civilization
- **Pacific Deep**: Video game set in underground cities below the Pacific Ocean during Laputian golden age (~1000 AD)
- **Main Character**: Engineering robot inspired by Wall-E, R2-D2, and Miyazaki's robots - heartwarming, alien, non-verbal

## Repository Structure

- `Lore/` - Worldbuilding for Laputian culture, philosophy, history, technology
- `Pacific Deep the video game/Story/` - Game narrative, city descriptions, quests
- `Pacific Deep the video game/Implementation/` - Technical ideas for the 2D game engine (no engine used, custom development)
- `Pacific Deep the video game/Concept Art and Graphics/` - Visual design assets
- `Diary/` - Personal development log dated YYYY-MM-DD.md format

## Writing Conventions

### Tone and Style
- Maintain **thoughtful, exploratory** tone - this is active worldbuilding, not finalized canon
- Use phrases like "might be", "could be", "probably" when ideas are still forming
- Balance scientific plausibility with fantasy elements (e.g., aetherium is fantastical, but Earth history is science-based)
- Keep writing **accessible and warm** - avoid academic dryness

### Laputian Values in Writing
When describing Laputian culture, consistently emphasize:
- **Beauty as decision-making principle** ("is it beautiful?" guides all choices)
- **Non-violence and cooperation** (even though military tech exists)
- **Post-scarcity economy** enabling free pursuit of interests
- **Open-source mindset** - all knowledge shared by default
- **Equality and justice** as foundational values

### Game Design Philosophy
- **Non-violent exploration preferred** but violence possible (with consequences: alert state, being chased)
- **Modular/combinatorial systems** (e.g., robot parts, synthesizer instruments)
- **Discovery-driven progression** (unlock music, building instructions, areas through exploration/quests)
- **No hand-holding** - player freedom is paramount, even for destructive actions
- **Music is central** - 100+ classical Laputian pieces, synthesizer instruments as "singing voices"

## Key Reference Files

- [README.md](README.md) - High-level overview of both lore and game
- [Lore/who are Laputians.md](Lore/who are Laputians.md) - Core cultural values, philosophy, "Beautiful Life" concept
- [Pacific Deep the video game/Story/cities.md](Pacific Deep the video game/Story/cities.md) - Detailed city descriptions (R&D, Musical, Preservation, etc.)
- [Diary/2026-01-19.md](Diary/2026-01-19.md) - Development vision: 2D top-down, late 90s aesthetic, custom engine, ~130 synthesizer instruments already created

## Cross-References

- When writing about city features, check [cities.md](Pacific Deep the video game/Story/cities.md) for consistency
- Link Laputian cultural elements back to [Lore/who are Laputians.md](Lore/who are Laputians.md)
- Technical implementation ideas go in `Implementation/` directory
- Use markdown relative links between related documents

## Common Tasks

### Adding New Lore
1. Check if topic overlaps with existing files in `Lore/`
2. Use section headers consistently (## for main topics, ### for subtopics)
3. Add "To be written..." placeholders for incomplete sections rather than leaving blank

### Designing Game Content
1. New cities/areas go in [Story/cities.md](Pacific Deep the video game/Story/cities.md)
2. Quest ideas go in [Story/quests and missions.md](Pacific Deep the video game/Story/quests and missions.md)
3. Technical considerations go in `Implementation/` (graphics, audio, mechanics)

### Maintaining Consistency
- **Timeline**: Laputian golden age ~1000 AD, civilization existed 5000 BC - 1300 AD
- **Setting**: Pacific Deep is 6000m below ocean surface
- **Tech Level**: Advanced robotics/AI, aetherium-powered, but retro 2D aesthetic for game
- **No living beings harmed**: All game inhabitants are robots

## What NOT to Do

- Don't add code files or software dependencies - this is a documentation-only project
- Don't formalize/rigidify lore that's still exploratory - preserve the "work in progress" nature
- Don't contradict the non-violent, beauty-focused Laputian philosophy
- Don't suggest 3D graphics or game engines - the vision is custom 2D, late-90s style
