Ecosystems that are based on the glow of aetherium and plants. Including also maybe animals (huge monsters eventually encountered by the Laputians)

----

Element of horror created by a trauma at the beginning of the game. Maybe something terrible happened to the good friends of the main character.

The main character manages to escape to a submarine and go to different underwater city without hostile welcome. Later in the game, after getting stronger, the main character returns to the original city to explore.
