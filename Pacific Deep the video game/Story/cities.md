## The Cities In the Depths

Pacific Deep is a collection of interconnected underground cities located deep below the surface of Pacific Ocean. These cities were built by the ancient Laputian civilization to harvest the valuable mineral aetherium, which was used to power their advanced technology, including their flying castles.

At the beginning of the game the player character starts as a newly-built engineering robot in Research and Development City. The player has the option to explore all the different cities (maybe needing to do some sort of quests to unlock the access to some of them)

In addition to the functional parts of each city, every city also contains the lodgings for the robots working there. The robots do not need food, water, or sleep, but they do need some form of recreation and social interaction. The lodging areas provide a place for the robots to relax and do fun activities (such as playing computer games or living in a virtual reality; the primary game will contain several "game within games", or minigames that are totally playable).

All sort of presentations and shows are held in the cities from time to time, such as musical concerts, art exhibitions and new technology releases. The player may attend these events for recreation or to learn more about the Laputian culture. They are scheduled regularly, so that each day or so there might be events happening in some city.

### Research and Development City

This city contains laboratories, workshops, and testing facilities where new technologies and inventions are developed. In addition to the player character, dozens, if not hundreds of other engineering robots work here, each with their own specialties and skills. The player will learn instructions for hundreds of different devices as they progress through the game. Any device which building instructions are known to the player can be built and used by the player and the non-player characters. 

Some of the technologies developed here include:
* new sorts of robots and machines (some conscious, some not)
    - a kind of modular principle might be used, so that the player may combine different parts for totally unique creations
* accessories which enhance the capabilities of existing robots or human Laputians
* biotechnology for either aesthetic purposes (such as flowers thriving in the glow of aetherium), or for the use of the human Laputians
* new materials for construction (such as more durable, or more lightweight, to be used in the flying cities)
* new ways to utilize aetherium mineral
* confidential military technologies (the Laputian civilization had a military too, although it was not their main focus)
    - The player will eventually learn to build weapons and other military devices and use them as one wishes. 
    - Almost everything in the game world can be destroyed and killed. The game will not encourage violence, but it will not prevent it either. 
    - Doing violence will initiate a state of alert in the cities and if the player is seen doing violence, the player will be chased and possibly "deactivated" (killed).
    - There are many locked areas in the game (such as the lodgings of other robots), which are only accessible by exploding the doors or walls.

### Preservation City

This is city is a combination of libraries, museums, and archives. Its purpose is to preserve the knowledge and culture of the Laputian civilization for future generations. Exploring this city is the main way to learn about the Laputian culture. Some parts of this city will be available only by solving things, e.g. puzzles or quests. The player character might also find instructions on how to build all sorts of devices.

The player may learn more about these:
* Who the Laputians are
    * The history
    * The culture
        - All laputians are experts of one sort or another. They value knowledge and beauty above all else.
        - In addition to specialization, all laputians are highly educated in science, technology, arts, and practical skills.
        - What type of flying and underground cities they live in and why
    * The science and technology
        - About the aetherium mineral; how it enabled the birth of the culture
        - The advanced robotics and AI
    * The philosophy, religion and politics
        - The Laputian civilization values co-operation and peaceful coexistence above all else. Violence is only used as a last resort.
        - The Laputians believe in the pursuit of knowledge and beauty as the highest goals in life.
        - The Laputians have a deep respect for nature and the environment, and strive to live in harmony with the natural world.
        - There are no political parties. Every political problem is solved by dedicating the issue to the experts of the particular field, who will possibly do new research as much as possible, so that the most practical option is uncovered.
        - Every Laputian "drinks the sense of equality and justice from the mother's milk", as the saying goes.
        - Each Laputian has the right to believe in whatever religion or philosophy they wish, as long as it does not harm others. Anyhow, their universal education leads 99.9 % of the time to the religion of "Compassion and Curiosity".

### Musical City

The experience of beauty is one of the most important guiding principles for each resident of the Laputian civilization, both robots and human Laputians. They are interested in all sorts of art, visual or auditory, but music is especially important.

There are Laputian robots or machines that can kind of "sing" (they have soundproducing bodyparts, which are pretty much equivalent to synthesizers with loudspeakers). There are dozens (maybe more than hundred) different kind of singing voices (or different kind of synthesizer instruments). New singing voices (or synthesizer instruments) can be uncovered as the game progresses.

Within this city, there is a music hall where the singing robots perform concerts, which are scheduled about daily or weekly or so.

There might be a repertoire of about 100 classical Laputian music pieces. Some of those might be lost initially, but which can be uncovered by the player as the game progresses. The performer robots sing those pieces in the concerts, and the player may also invent an "mp3 player" through which the player may listen to any uncovered music piece at any time (this is the primary way of having background music; the minigames may contain musical pieces of their own).

There might be a "practice room" in the game, in which the player can play with all the uncovered synthesizer instruments, if they have a midi controller connected to the PC.
